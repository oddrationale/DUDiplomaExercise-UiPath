					address
					city-town-state-zip
					single-married-filing-separately
					married-filing-jointly
					employers-name-address
					employment-date
					employer-identification-number
					
		Group:		Forms
		Category:	IRS
		Document:	1040A
		Fields:		first-name
					last-name
					social-security-number
					home-address
					city-town-zip
					apt-no
					dependants (tabel)
						first-last-name
						social-security-number
						relationship
						child-tax-credit
					account-number

		Group:		Reports
		Category:	SEC
		Document:	10-x
		Fields:		form-type
					commision-file-number
					irs-employer-identification-no
					telephone-number
					
		Group:		Accounting
		Category:	Incoming
		Document:	Invoice
		Fields:		name
					vendor-address
					billing-name
					billing-addr
					shipping-addr
					invoice-no
					payment-terms
					due-date
					po-no
					date
					net-amount
					tax
					total
					currency
					items
						line-no
						description
						item-po-no
						quantity
						unit-price
						line-amount
	
	b. Edit the taxonomy for W4 and 1040A and add a 'signature' field
	
2. Load the taxonomy and digitize all the documents in the input folder
	a. Use Microsoft OCR Engine
	b. Use Omnipage OCR Engine

3. Use the keyword classifier to classify between the documents in the input folder

4. Extract data from the documents:
	a. Use the Form extractor for the W4 and 1040A type documents
	b. Use the Intelligent Form Extractor to check if a signature is present on the W4 and 1040A documents
	c. Use the extractors from both a) and b) at the same time, where b) only extracts the signature.
	d. Use the Regex Extractor to extract the fields from the 10k and 10q documents
	e. Use the Machine Learning Extractor to extract the fields for the Invoice defined at point 1.
	f. Have a workflow where you use all the extractors, by using the classifier at point 3.

5. Use the validation station to validate the extracted data in case there are any mistakes

6. Save the Extracted Data and to an excel spreadsheet by using the 'export extraction results' activity and saving the dataset that comes as an output. 
	- The Data has to be saved while running the Omnipage OCR Engine!
	- The Dataset will contain several tables, please save one table/sheet!!
	- Remember to check the 'add headers' option in the write range activity!!!
