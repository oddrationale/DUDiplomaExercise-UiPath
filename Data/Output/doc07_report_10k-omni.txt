SPECIALNOTEREGARDINGFORWARD-LOOKINGSTATEMENTS

In light of the risks and uncertainties inherent in allprojected operationalmatters, the inclusion of forward-looking statements in this Form10-K, should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that any of our objectives or plans willbe achieved or that any of our operating expectations willbe realized.
Our revenues and results of operations are difficult to forecast and could differ materially fromthose projected in the forward-looking statements contained in this Form10-K, as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, our business reliance on third parties to provide us with technology, our ability to integrate and manage acquired technology, assets, companies and personnel, changes in market condition, the volatile and intensely competitive environment in the business sectors in which we operate, rapid technologicalchange, and our dependence on key and scarce employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel.
These factors should not be considered exhaustive; we undertake no obligation to release publicly the results of any future revisions we may make to forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

PART I

Except for historicalinformation, this report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21Eof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").
Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, statements regarding our business strategy, future revenues and anticipated costs and expenses.
Such forward-looking statements include, among others, those statements including the words "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "believes" and similar language.
Our actualresults may differ significantly fromthose projected in the forward-looking statements.
Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section "Item7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations." You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speakonly as of the date of this report.
We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward-looking statements or reflect events or circumstances taking place after the date of this document.

Item1. Business. The Company

We were initially incorporated on November 4, 1999, as Menu Sites, Inc., a Florida corporation.
On March 9, 2001, we changed our name to CNECommunications, Inc. On October 1, 2004, we changed our name to CNEIndustries, Inc.
On March 29, 2005, we changed our name to GlobalTelIP, Inc. On May 9, 2008, we changed our name to Cleartronic, Inc.

Allof our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries, VoiceInterop, Inc., a Florida corporation, incorporated on November 13, 2007, and ReadyOp Communications, Inc., a Florida corporation, incorporated on September 15, 2014, which facilitate the marketing and sales of ReadyOp™software and AudioMate IP gateways, discussed below.

Business Overview

We do not currently have sufficient capitalto conduct the present or proposed business activities described below.
The costs to operate our business are approximately $115,000per month.
In order for us to cover our monthly operating expenses, we must generate revenues of approximately $175,000per month.
Accordingly, in the absence of revenues, we must secure $115,000in equity or debt capitaleach month to cover our overhead expenses.
In order to remain in business for one year without any revenues, we must secure $1,380,000in equity or debt capital.
If we are unsuccessfulin securing sufficient capitalor revenues, we willbe unable to continue any business activities.
We have not obtained any commitments for additionalcapital, and we may not be able to obtain any additionalcapitalon terms not unfavorable to us, if at all.
FromMarch 2005to October 2007, we were primarily engaged in providing telecommunications services to our customers employing Voice over Internet Protocol(VoIP) technology.
In October 2007, we sold substantially allof our assets utilized in that business.
Prior to 2005, we were a website development company.

We are nowa provider of Internet Protocol, or IP, unified group communication solutions.
The products used in our solutions include our own proprietary products as wellas products fromother software and hardware vendors.

We have designed and customized standards based audio and voice collaboration solutions for prospective customers as part of a unified group communication system.
We consider allaspects of a potentialcustomer's information technology resources and existing telecommunications networkin creating a design best suited for that customer.
In 2013, we developed our own proprietary group communication solution and have built and installed four of these solutions as of the filing date of this report.
Prior to developing our own solution we used WAVE software as the core component.
We have designed, built and installed 20unified group communication solutions as of the filing date of this report, 14of which utilize WAVE software.
In November 2013, we discontinued using WAVE software as a component in our unified communication solution installations.

Revenues have been generated fromthe design, construction and installation of the group communication systems.
We have also generated revenues frommaintenance and support contracts, once a unified group communication solution has been installed and tested.
While we no longer sellWAVE based systems we willcontinue to support the installations that we have previously installed.
We also sellour proprietary line of Internet ProtocolGateways which we have branded the AudioMate 360 IP Gateway, discussed below.
These units are currently being sold directly to end-users and by Value Added Resellers ("VARs").
As of the date of this filing, we have approximately 10active VARs, and we have sold our gateways to more than 1,000end-users in the United States and 18foreign countries.

We have developed an Internet ProtocolGateway which we callthe AudioMate 360 IP Gateway.
The AudioMate 360 IP Gateway has been designed to provide an Internet ProtocolGateway to users of unified group communications.
The AudioMate 360 IP Gateway is available in different configurations which enable it to be used with various types of communications equipment.

Although other devices are available that performthe same or similar functions, we believe that our price for the AudioMate 360 IP Gateway is substantially lower than the prices others are presently charging for similar devices.
If we are unable to provide the AudioMate 360 IP Gateway to our prospective customers at substantially lower prices than others are charging for similar gateways, our business willbe materially adversely affected.

We do not have any other products at this time.

Acquisition of Certain CollabriaAssets

In March 2015, the Company amended its Licensing Agreement with Collabria LLCof Tampa, Florida ("Collabria").
The Agreement grants the Company master distribution rights to market, selland support Collabria's command and controlsoftware, trade-named ReadyOp.
ReadyOp software is designed for fast, efficient access to information and for communication with multiple persons, groups and agencies.
This agreement willremain in effect for an initialtermof five years unless either the Company or Collabria sooner terminates the agreement.
Upon expiration of the agreement, the Company's only obligation to Collabria shallbe the payment of alloutstanding obligations to Collabria.
In September 2014, the Company formed ReadyOp Communications, Inc. (a Florida corporation), as a wholly owned subsidiary to facilitate the marketing of ReadyOp software.
According to the terms of the agreement ReadyOp Communications willpay Collabria a royalty for allReadyOp software sold.

In November 2016, the Company cancelled its Licensing Agreement with Collabria LLCof Tampa, Florida ("Collabria") and acquired allof the intellectualproperty related to Collabria's command and controlsoftware, trade-named ReadyOp.
In addition the Company acquired Collabria's client list.
In exchange for these assets the Company issued Collabria 3,000,000shares of the Company's restricted Series EConvertible Preferred stockwith a fair value of $292,240.
The Company assumed none of Collabria's liabilities.

Needfor UnifiedGroupCommunications

Unified group communications and coordination within and between agencies for response actions to incidents and emergencies has been a challenge for many years.
The result has been inefficiencies and in some cases the loss of lives, time and money during response activities.
Governmentalagencies, hospitals and other organizations experience these same interoperability failures.
